Prototyping an A* algorithm will address, and ideally, mitigate the risk of incomplete autonomous movement on the rover. This prototyping will involve solving a maze with obstacles in it by finding the shortest path between the start and end nodes. We plan to write our final scripts in Python, so we will also prototype our A* algorithm in Python. This requires a Python IDE such as PyCharm and additional libraries such as NumPy (available for download through PyCharm). The plan is to write code and have a code review at the end of every week leading up to the deadline, constantly updating our GitHub repository. If time allows and we are ahead of schedule, a stretch goal is to create a visualization of the maze solving algorithm using a Python library such as Pygame. To test our A* prototype, we will input several mazes (2D arrays with size to be determined later) with randomized obstacles in the form of blocks that cannot be moved through. The algorithm at a most basic level should output the shortest path from start to finish, either in text or showing the steps in a printed 2D array. The time complexity should be O(bd) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the solution. We will evaluate the ability to find the shortest path from start to end.
